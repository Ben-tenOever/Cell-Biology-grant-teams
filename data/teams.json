We aim to understand how these cells change and develop to a degree that we can control for future clinical applications.; Andrea H. Brand: Neural stem cells in the adult brain exist primarily in a quiescent state but can be reactivated in response to changing physiological conditions. The ability to reactivate neural stem cells in situ raises the prospect of potential future therapies for brain repair after damage or neurodegenerative disease.; Hyung Don Ryoo: My laboratory primarily uses Drosophila to investigate how cells mount stress-response signaling and how those mechanisms affect degenerative disease models. Of particular interest to us is the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which respond to misfolded protein overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), amino acid deficiency, and mitochondrial stress..",
