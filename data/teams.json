Key contributions: Catherine Pei-ju Lu: My lab aims to build a comprehensive framework for understanding stem cell biology of the skin, from development to disease. Our research will center on three interconnected themes:  Stem Cell Plasticity and Regeneration: We will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which sweat gland progenitors re-enter developmental programs after injury, with the goal of identifying pathways that can be therapeutically targeted to enhance regeneration.; esteban o mazzoni: We are passionate about understanding how cells acquire the functions required by a multicellular organism like the complex human body. We aim to understand how these cells change and develop to a degree that we can control for future clinical applications.; Elaine (Lyn) Wilson: My major contributions have been to the field of tumor cell biology, and more recently to the relationship between normal prostate stem and prostate tumor cells. It is likely that the aberrant proliferation of prostate stem cells and/or their progenitors contributes directly to prostate pathology.; Dimitris Placantonakis: glioblastoma; chromatin organization in human neural development; adhesions GPCR function and therapeutics.",
