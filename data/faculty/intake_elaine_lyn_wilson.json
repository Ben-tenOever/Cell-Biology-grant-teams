  "lab_synopsis": "My major contributions have been to the field of tumor cell biology, and more recently to the relationship between normal prostate stem and prostate tumor cells. It is likely that the aberrant proliferation of prostate stem cells and/or their progenitors contributes directly to prostate pathology. My laboratory has focused on the isolation and characterization of the stem and progenitor cell populations of the adult and the fetal prostate and their contribution to malignant transformation. We were the first to identify the proximal region of murine prostatic ducts as being enriched in stem cells that express high levels of Sca-1, are quiescent and have high proliferative potential in vitro and in vivo (Tsujimura et al 2002). In addition, single proximal cells give rise to branched ductal structures that contain both basal and luminal cells. Cells from this region have significant regenerative capacity when assayed in an in vivo prostate reconstitution assay in which combinations of prostate cells and embryonic urogenital sinus mesenchyme (inductive mesenchyme for prostatic tissue) are inserted under the renal capsule of recipient animals. Proximal cells also withstand prolonged androgen deprivation, another characteristic of stem cells. Sca-1high prostate regenerating cells also express other antigens characteristic of stem cells such as alpha 6 integrin, aldehyde dehydrogenase and Bcl-2. High levels of TGF-beta in the proximal region maintain the quiescence of the proximal stem cell niche (Salm et al 2005). The global gene expression profiles of adult and fetal prostate stem cells indicate that adult stem cells express a unique repertoire of genes, many of which are involved in quiescence (Blum et al 2010). We find that aberrant activation of components of prostate stem cell pathways contribute to the development of prostate tumors. My current research is directed at identifying molecules that can serve as targets for treating patients with prostate cancer. We have recently identified several molecules, including KLF4, that regulate both stem cell function and malignant transformation, including targetable molecules for potentially treating tumors. In addition, we have identified a biomarker signature that predicts those patients with indolent disease who have a prolonged relapse-free survival. Importantly, this signature can also stratify patients with low Gleason scores (Xiong et al 2018).",
