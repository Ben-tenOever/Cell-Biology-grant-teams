Key contributions: Elaine (Lyn) Wilson: My major contributions have been to the field of tumor cell biology, and more recently to the relationship between normal prostate stem and prostate tumor cells. It is likely that the aberrant proliferation of prostate stem cells and/or their progenitors contributes directly to prostate pathology.; esteban o mazzoni: We are passionate about understanding how cells acquire the functions required by a multicellular organism like the complex human body. We aim to understand how these cells change and develop to a degree that we can control for future clinical applications.; Andrea H. Brand: Neural stem cells in the adult brain exist primarily in a quiescent state but can be reactivated in response to changing physiological conditions. The ability to reactivate neural stem cells in situ raises the prospect of potential future therapies for brain repair after damage or neurodegenerative disease.; Hyung Don Ryoo: My laboratory primarily uses Drosophila to investigate how cells mount stress-response signaling and how those mechanisms affect degenerative disease models. Of particular interest to us is the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which respond to misfolded protein overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), amino acid deficiency, and mitochondrial stress..",
